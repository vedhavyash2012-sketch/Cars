    <h1>BMW</h1>
    <p>First generation (E23; 1977)</p>
    
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/BMW_733i_--_01-07-2012.jpg/250px-BMW_733i_--_01-07-2012.jpg" align="left" width="400" height="200">
    <p>The E23 is the first generation 7 Series and was produced from 1977 to 1987. It was built in a 4-door sedan style with 6-cylinder engines, to replace the E3 sedans. From 1983 to 1987, a turbocharged 6-cylinder engine was available in some markets.

The E23 introduced many electronic features for the first time in a BMW, including an onboard computer, a service interval indicator, a "check control panel" (warning lights to indicate system faults to the driver), a dictaphone, and complex climate control systems. It was also the first BMW to offer an anti-lock braking system (ABS), a driver's airbag, and double-link front suspension.</p>

    <p>Second generation (E32; 1986)</p>

    <p>The E32 is the second generation of the 7 Series, which was produced from 1986 to 1994. It was initially available with a straight-six or V12 engine, the latter being Germany's first passenger car with a V12 since World War II. In 1992, V8 engines became available.

The E32 introduced the following features for the first time in a BMW: Electronic Damper Control,[3] V12 and V8 engines, double glazing, the CAN bus electronic protocol,[4] Xenon headlamps,[5] traction control[6] and dual-zone climate control.[7] The E32 750i was the first car adhering to BMW's self-imposed speed limit of 250 km/h (155 mph).[8] The 'iL' models re-introduced a long-wheelbase option not offered by BMW since the 'L' variants of the E3 "New Six".</p>
